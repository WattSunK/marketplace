# S1-T5 Kickoff Notes — Lease–Payment Linkage & Derived Totals
_Date: 07 Oct 2025_

## 🎯 Objective
Establish relational joins between **leases ↔ payments** to support linked financial records, per-lease payment summaries, and computed balances.  
This sprint enables a clear financial view for each lease, showing how much has been paid, how much is due, and providing data for automated reporting and reconciliation.

---

## 🧱 Scope

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Migration** | Add `lease_id INTEGER REFERENCES leases(id)` to `payments`. |
| **Backfill** | Populate `lease_id` for existing payments by matching `tenant_id` + `unit_id` to existing leases. |
| **API Updates** | Extend `/api/payments` to show linked lease details; update `/api/leases/:id` to include payment history. |
| **Computed Fields** | Expose `total_rent`, `total_paid`, and `balance_due` for each lease via aggregation of linked payments. |
| **Health Endpoint** | Extend `/api/health` to report counts of linked vs unlinked payments. |
| **Testing & Validation** | Create `tests/api_lease_payment_verify.sh` following S1-T4 pattern, verifying joins and computed totals. |

---

## ⚙️ SQL Migration Outline
File: `scripts/sql/2025-10-08_add_lease_id_to_payments.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN lease_id INTEGER REFERENCES leases(id);

-- Backfill payments using tenant/unit matching logic
UPDATE payments
SET lease_id = (
  SELECT l.id
  FROM leases l
  WHERE l.tenant_id = payments.tenant_id
    AND l.unit_id = payments.unit_id
  LIMIT 1
)
WHERE lease_id IS NULL;
```

## 🧪 Verification Plan

| Step | Endpoint | Expected Result |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | `GET /api/payments` | Each record includes `lease_id` and lease summary (property/unit). |
| 2 | `GET /api/leases/:id` | Returns nested `payments[]` and computed totals. |
| 3 | `GET /api/health` | Reports linked/unlinked payment counts. |
| 4 | `GET /api/payments?lease_id=1` | Filters by lease correctly. |
| 5 | `GET /api/leases` | Aggregated totals visible inline per lease. |
| 6 | Test script | `tests/api_lease_payment_verify.sh` passes all checks. |

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] Database migration applied (`lease_id` added to `payments`).  
- [ ] Backfill completed successfully.  
- [ ] `/api/payments` shows linked lease data.  
- [ ] `/api/leases/:id` exposes nested payment history.  
- [ ] Computed fields `total_rent`, `total_paid`, `balance_due` verified.  
- [ ] `/api/health` displays payment linkage counts.  
- [ ] All automated verification steps pass.  
- [ ] Commit tagged as **`S1-T5-complete`**.

### 🧭 Next Phase Preview
S1-T6 will extend the financial model with **invoicing**, **receipts**, and optional **tenant payment schedules**, building on these payment-link foundations.


# S1-T5 Update Notes — Lease–Payment Linkage & Derived Totals
_Date: 08 Oct 2025_

## ✅ Summary of Achievements
S1-T5 successfully implemented and verified the **Lease ↔ Payment linkage** layer, providing per-lease payment summaries, computed balances, and reliable health metrics.

| Area | Outcome |
|-------|----------|
| **Schema** | `payments` table confirmed to include `lease_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES leases(id)` with active foreign-key enforcement. |
| **Data Integrity** | 4 / 4 payments correctly linked to valid leases; `unlinked = 0`. |
| **APIs Updated** | `/api/payments` enriched with lease / unit / property context.<br>`/api/leases` and `/api/leases/:id` expose totals: `total_rent`, `total_paid`, `balance_due`. |
| **Health Endpoint** | `/api/health` extended to show `payments_linkage { linked, unlinked }` counts. |
| **Testing** | `tests/api_lease_payment_verify.sh` executed end-to-end with no errors after authentication fix. |
| **Verification** | SQL joins, role-based access, and totals confirmed via `curl + sqlite3` probes. |
| **Tag** | `S1-T5-complete` pushed to GitHub (`Lease–Payment linkage & derived totals verified`). |

## 🧩 Technical Notes
- No migration required — schema already compliant.  
- Incremental patch added computed-total logic to `routes/leases.js` and linkage counts to `routes/system-health.js`.  
- Role middleware adjusted (`requireAnyRole`) to restore admin access.  
- All session and dependency issues resolved (`express-session`, `connect-sqlite3`, `better-sqlite3`, `joi`, etc.).

## 🧪 Verification Evidence
**Database Results**
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total, SUM(CASE WHEN lease_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS linked
FROM payments;
→ 4 total / 4 linked / 0 unlinked
```
**Lease Summary**
```
Lease 1: rent = 1600 KSH, paid = 3300 KSH → balance = -1700 (over-paid)
Lease 2: rent = 1500 KSH, paid = 0 → balance = 1500 (due)
```
**API Verification**
```
/api/payments         → contextual lease + property data visible  
/api/leases/:id       → totals & nested payments confirmed  
/api/health           → payments_linkage { linked: 4, unlinked: 0 }
```

## 🏁 Definition of Done — Confirmed
☑ Database structure verified  
☑ All payments linked  
☑ Computed totals accurate  
☑ Health metrics extended  
☑ Automated script executed successfully  
☑ Tag `S1-T5-complete` created and pushed

## 🔜 Transition to S1-T6
Next sprint (**Invoicing & Receipts Layer**) builds directly on this verified linkage to support invoice generation, receipt issuance, and financial document tracking.
