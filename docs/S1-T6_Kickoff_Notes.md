# S1-T6 Kickoff Notes ‚Äî Invoicing & Receipts Layer
_Date: 08 Oct 2025_

## üéØ Objective
Extend the financial subsystem by introducing **Invoices** and **Receipts** built on the verified lease‚Äìpayment linkage (S1‚ÄëT5).  
This sprint formalizes rent cycles, payment tracking, and document traceability, enabling automated reporting and audit trails.

---

## üß± Scope

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Invoices Table** | Store rent charge entries generated from active leases. Each invoice includes lease_id, period_start, period_end, amount_cents, status, and issued_at. |
| **Receipts Table** | Record confirmed payments referencing invoices. Includes payment_id, invoice_id, amount_cents, receipt_number, and issued_at. |
| **Relationships** | invoices.lease_id ‚Üí leases.id; receipts.payment_id ‚Üí payments.id; receipts.invoice_id ‚Üí invoices.id. |
| **API Endpoints** | `/api/invoices` (CRUD + filters by lease_id/status) and `/api/receipts` (list + issue receipt). |
| **Health Extension** | `/api/health` to include counts of `invoices_issued` and `receipts_logged`. |
| **Testing & Validation** | Create `tests/api_invoice_receipt_verify.sh` verifying full issue‚Üípayment‚Üíreceipt flow. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Migration Outline
File: `scripts/sql/2025-10-09_create_invoices_receipts.sql`

```sql
-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Invoices table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS invoices (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  lease_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES leases(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  period_start DATE NOT NULL,
  period_end DATE NOT NULL,
  amount_cents INTEGER NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'Unpaid',
  issued_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Receipts table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS receipts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  invoice_id INTEGER REFERENCES invoices(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  payment_id INTEGER REFERENCES payments(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  amount_cents INTEGER NOT NULL,
  receipt_number TEXT UNIQUE,
  issued_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoices_lease ON invoices(lease_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_receipts_invoice ON receipts(invoice_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_receipts_payment ON receipts(payment_id);
```

## üß™ Verification Plan

| Step | Endpoint | Expected Result |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | `POST /api/invoices` | Creates invoice linked to lease; returns ID and amount. |
| 2 | `GET /api/invoices?lease_id=1` | Lists invoices for lease; correct totals and status shown. |
| 3 | `POST /api/receipts` | Creates receipt referencing invoice and payment. |
| 4 | `GET /api/receipts?invoice_id=1` | Returns all receipts linked to invoice. |
| 5 | `GET /api/health` | Reports `invoices_issued` and `receipts_logged` counts. |
| 6 | Run `tests/api_invoice_receipt_verify.sh` | All verifications pass. |

### üß≠ Next Phase Preview
S1‚ÄëT7 will extend this foundation with **automated billing cycles** (monthly invoice generation), **tenant notifications**, and **ledger reconciliation** for landlords and admins.
