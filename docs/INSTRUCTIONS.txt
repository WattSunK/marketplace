Step 6.4 - Customer Reflection (merge admin overlay into reads)

1) Add the new route:
   - Copy routes/admin-orders-meta.js → your project's routes/ folder
   - Mount it in server.js:
       app.use("/api/admin/orders/meta", require("./routes/admin-orders-meta"));

2) Replace the admin Orders controller:
   - Copy public/admin/js/orders-controller.js → replace your file
   - Keep the script include order in public/dashboard.html (adapter -> controller -> edit -> dashboard)

3) (Optional but recommended) Customer-side auto-refresh:
   - Copy public/myaccount/orders-refresh-hooks.js
   - Include it on the My Orders / Track page:
       <script src="./myaccount/orders-refresh-hooks.js?v=1" defer></script>

4) Restart the server, hard-refresh the browser.

Smoke test:
  - Admin Orders list shows edited status after reload (overlay merged).
  - Edit an order status, then switch to the customer view tab and focus it;
    it should re-fetch and show the new status.
