# Tenant–Landlord Marketplace — Phase S1-T3 Developer Notes
_Date: 09 Oct 2025_

---

## 🎯 Objective
Introduce the **Lease** and **Payment** integration layer that links tenants, units, and landlords.  
Adds `/api/leases` and `/api/payments` endpoints, plus SQL migrations for the new tables.

## ⚙️ Installation & Migration

```bash
# Ensure DB is accessible
sqlite3 data/dev/marketplace.dev.db ".tables"

# Apply migration
sqlite3 data/dev/marketplace.dev.db < scripts/sql/2025-10-09_create_leases_payments.sql


Tables expected:

leases
payments
lease_balances (VIEW)

🚀 API Mount Check

Confirm these lines exist in server.js:

import leasesRouter from "./routes/leases.js";
import paymentsRouter from "./routes/payments.js";

app.use("/api/leases", leasesRouter);
app.use("/api/payments", paymentsRouter);


Restart:

sudo node server.js

🧪 Smoke Verification
bash tests/api_leases_payments.sh


Expected:

/api/leases → { success:true, data:[...] }

/api/payments → { success:true, data:[...] }

/api/health → includes leases and payments counts.

🧠 Developer Tips
Area	Note
Pagination	Controlled by ?page= and ?per= in /api/leases.
Role-based Access	requireAnyRole(["admin","landlord","tenant"]) used in both routes.
Balance Calculation	Derived from SQL view lease_balances.
Testing	Use separate cookies (admin.jar, landlord.jar, tenant.jar) for role-scoped curl tests.
✅ Definition of Done
Task	Status
Lease + Payment tables migrated	☐
/api/leases and /api/payments CRUD implemented	☐
Role guards enforced	☐
/api/health includes counts	☐
All curl tests pass	☐
Tag commit → S1-T3-complete	☐

### 🧾 Verification Plan for S1-T3

Once this README and starter pack are deployed:

1. **Run Migration**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 data/dev/marketplace.dev.db < scripts/sql/2025-10-09_create_leases_payments.sql
   sqlite3 data/dev/marketplace.dev.db ".tables"


→ confirm leases, payments, and lease_balances.

Mount Routes
In server.js add:

app.use("/api/leases", leasesRouter);
app.use("/api/payments", paymentsRouter);


Restart Server

sudo node server.js


Smoke Test

bash tests/api_leases_payments.sh


Functional Test

POST /api/leases to create lease

POST /api/payments to add payment

GET /api/leases/:id → should show embedded payments & balance

GET /api/health → should show new entity counts

Tag after success

git add .
git commit -m "S1-T3: Lease & Payment APIs verified"
git tag -a S1-T3-complete -m "Lease & Payment Integration verified"
git push origin main --tags
